"""Data serialization utility with multiple compression support.

This module provides a comprehensive serialization class that supports various 
compression algorithms for efficient data storage and transmission:

- Blosc family: blosclz, lz4, lz4hc, zlib, zstd (via python-blosc)
- Standard library: gzip, bz2, zipfile, lzma
- External: snappy (via python-snappy)

The Serializer class handles automatic fallback when compression libraries are not 
available and provides both in-memory (dumps/loads) and file-based (dump/load) 
serialization methods.
